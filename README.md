### Structured Data 

    • Well defined dataframe.


### Unstructured Data

    • Audio, Image, Texts are the Unstructured Data.

#### Audio is 1 dimensional Time Series.


### Data and Performance 



The amount of data and the size of neural network both are dependent on the performance of the model.
    • The choice of algorithm is one of the most important things for data computation. For example choosing ReLU in place of a Sigmoidal function can make computation faster.
